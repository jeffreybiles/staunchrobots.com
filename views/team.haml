                %h3 What we do:
                %h3 We create top quality code
                %p We recruit inpired local talent, and put them through a grueling best pracices training program, where we drill in best OOP techniques inspired by http://objectsonrails.com/. The result is a standardized way of doing things, that tend to be elegant, readable, and maintaible. 
                %h3 We value Communication
                %p We value clear communication equal to code quality. Programmers communicate directly with clients. We believe that a client should never have to ask what we are working on, because we should tell them before they ask. We also love quality time reports! Time Reports Guidelines Doc Link
                %h3 We love programming
                %p Its a cultural norm at our company to spend free time watching railscasts and reading technical blogs. ALl staunch programmers are passionate about programming, its not just a dayjob.
                %h3 Team Dynamics
                %p We believe that the key to serious productivity is great group dynamics. We work on projects as a team with different team members expecting daily deliverables, that the client can comprehend.  We read each other's code and create code that we are proud of being read.
                %h3 Over 75% of revenue flows to developers.
                %p We are very proud of our financial leanness. Over 75% of all company revenue goes to developers. We have virtually no sales, management, or administrative costs. Our programmers are expected to lead, and communicate profiently and directly. We pay the most amount of money we can to developers in order to attract and value the highest level of talent. We believe that in doing so, we dont need to add additional babysitting layers of management, and that in the end less people in the telephone game and higher productivity.

                %p Todd is the presidente of staunchrobots.com. Not has a degree in computer science and is a self professed not very good programmer, and only hires people that he considers substantially better than himself. Todd's major value in the company is moderating all client facing communications, and giving feedback to developers about how to communicate better. He believes that communication is as important as code quality, and holds all member's accountable to communication standards.
