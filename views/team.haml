                / %h3 What we do:
                %h3 Top coders making quality code
                %p 
                  We recruit inspired local talent, and put them through a grueling best practices training program, where we drill in best OOP techniques inspired by 
                  %a(href="http://objectsonrails.com/") http://objectsonrails.com/
                  \. The result is a standardized way of doing things, that tend to be elegant, readable, and maintainable. We believe the key to quality code is a quality developer, and only hire people passionate about and enjoy learning. 
                %h3 We value communication and group dynamics
                %p Developers are available and online during eastern standard time and work closely with our clients to get quick feedback.  Clients know what we are doing, and what we are going to do next. 
            
                
                %h3 Over 75% of revenue flows to developers.
                %p We are very proud of our financial leanness. Over 75% of all company revenue goes to developers. We have virtually no sales, management, or administrative costs. Our programmers are expected to lead, and communicate proficiently and directly. We pay the most amount of money we can to developers in order to attract and value the highest level of talent. Less layers of management,  means less people in the telephone game, and better efficiency.
